The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
	- add an &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">INIT</arg>&apos; attribute on signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">ALU_cmd</arg>&gt; (optimization is then done without any risk)
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="5">signal_encoding</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="6">user</arg>&apos; to avoid onehot optimization
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="7">safe_implementation</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="8">yes</arg>&apos; to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization
